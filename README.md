# Weatherify

Weatherify is my first Python web application, built using Flask. It allows users to check the current weather in any city by entering the city name in a search bar. The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, displaying the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit, along with humidity and wind speed.
